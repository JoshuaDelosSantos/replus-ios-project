# Main points
- Started defining initial database schema.
- Used ERD Editor in VSCode.
- Consulted with ChatGPT about schema.

## What I learned
- Used SERIAL for automatic ID generation.
- Changed CHAR to VARCHAR.
    - CHAR is a fixed-length type that pads values with spaces, which is rarely desired. 
- Removed user_id from Exercises since itâ€™s redundant.
- Use NUMERIC for weight for more precise and controlled numeric handling.
