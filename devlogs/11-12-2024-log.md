# Main points
- Started planning for IOS app.
- Started consulting with ChatGPT.
    - Industry best practices.
- Have no previous experience with Swift.
- Have experience with Kotlin.

# Research done
- MVVM
    - Combine or RxSwift for reactive data binding.
- Core Data vs. SQLite/Realm
    - Core Data: Apple’s native persistence framework. Great integration with iCloud syncing, supports complex object graphs, and is well-optimised.
    - Alternatives (Realm, GRDB, etc.): Simpler models and faster iterations. If your domain grows in complexity or you need more flexible queries, consider a robust alternative.
- Protocols for Abstraction
    - Introduce repository protocols (e.g., protocol SessionRepository { ... }) to separate the data layer from the domain and presentation layers. Implementing these with Core Data, SQLite, or a mock in tests becomes straightforward.
- Networking and Offline-First Considerations
    - Use modern APIs like URLSession or combine with frameworks like **Combine** or **Async/Await** (if targeting newer iOS versions) for asynchronous calls.
    - Consider caching strategies and offline capabilities early. For instance, store workouts locally first and sync to a backend if needed, ensuring a smooth user experience even without network connectivity.
- SwiftUI
    - If choosing SwiftUI, adopt state management patterns (like @State, @StateObject, @ObservedObject) and combine them with your MVVM structure for reactive UIs.
- Unit Tests and UI Tests Early
    - Start writing tests from the beginning. With MVVM, it’s simpler to write unit tests for your ViewModels.
    - For data handling, test your repositories with sample data. This ensures any changes you make later won’t break core functionalities.
- Use SwiftLint and SwiftFormat
- Consider User Privacy and Permissions
