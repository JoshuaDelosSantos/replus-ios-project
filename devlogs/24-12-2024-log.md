# Main points

- Refactored session.go file in repository layer to implement the DB interface.
- Created test file for session.go in repo layer.

# Problems

- Created tests for session.go in the repo layer.
- Encountered duplication error for mock db initialisation.
- Extracted function and created a new directory (internal/testutil)
- Created dbutil.go file in new directory.
- Turns out, I couldâ€™ve just renamed the mock db initialisation in each file to be unique.
    - I guess abstracting this function will make the codebase more maintanable
